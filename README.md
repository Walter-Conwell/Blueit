## Description

Welcome to Blueit, a sanctuary for your creative side. Blueit is a blog post application with a focus on blogposts, not all the hubbub and chaos of today’s social media sites. Forget the likes, forget smashing the subscribe button, just write. You can still share it with your friends, but you don’t have to concern yourself with others’ opinions, because we here at Blueit have disabled the ability to create comments. We are talking about unadulterated creation, unscathed by the grubby fingers of loathsome readers, at your disposal.

## Installation

This application requires no installation. You can visit the website as it is deployed on Heroku.

## Usage

This application is fairly simple. When presented with the opening page, the user will have the opportunity to view blogposts that already exist. If the user wants to create their own blogposts they simply need to singup to create a login. Once they signup they will automatically be logged in and create their own blogposts.
